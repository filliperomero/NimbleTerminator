## About The Project

[![Game ScreenShot][game-screenshot]](https://github.com/filliperomero/NimbleTerminator)

This project was developed in a Course where we created a Single Player Shooter Game with a variety of weapons like Assault Rifles, Submachine Guy and Pistol to choose from. We also implemented a pickup system where we can pickup different types of ammunition dropped on the floor and to put all together, a Inventory System where we can hold up to 6 weapons and select which weapon we want to use and see how much ammunition we have on each one.

We have a variety of enemies to defeat with different levels of difficult. The enemies are highly customizable and makes use of Behaviour Tree to Patrol, Agro, Chase and Attack the player.

We also have a Health system implemented on both Player and Enemy.
